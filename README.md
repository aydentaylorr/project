#### Description:

So for my final CS50 project, I decided to make a minimalist web-based weather app called Weather Watchdog that offers users a quick and easy weather checks because I find that many weather apps overwhelm users with excessive features which can hinder a exeperience that is mean't to be kept simple.

Weather Watchdog is a streamlined weather app which is focused on essential information like the temperature in a centrigrade scale, humidity and the winds speed. I also wanted it to be a user-friendly design so it can ensure a hassle-free user experience.

I used the two mark-up languages (HTML and CSS) for the page structure and style information and used JavaScript that would enable to create dynamically updating content, add interactivity and features to improve the user experience.

In my index.html file I included my main HTML code and made sure to link my CSS and JS file. My HTML file is where I laid out the structure of the website that I am creating and made sure to create div's and containers so that certain information went into certain places and made sure to link a image that I found on the web so if the user put's in a location that isn't found then a not found image will pop up on the screen.

In my styles.css file I worked on the main styles of the website and from there I worked the container styles, the search-box style, the weather box style, the not found image and then lastly I added the animations that I wanted to add animations so that once the user finds a location, the temperature, humidity, wind speed and the conditions of the weather fade in.

In my index.js file is where I included my weather API Key and linked openweathermaps.org/api so that I could get the temperature, wind speed, humidity and the weather conditions for any area in the world on the given time that they look for the weather.
